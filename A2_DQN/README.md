# Overview
requirements.txt contains list of required packages.

Run plot_rewards.py for plots shown in report (requires saved rewards from BATCHES folder)

If you wish to run the experiments yourself, Experiment.py runs the agent/environment and saves rewards and DQN weights. Change the parameters in main() depending on which settings you wish to run.
